## ðŸ“œ About

In this carefully curated modpack, my goal was to create an exciting adventure for players. It features around 200 meticulously designed mods that greatly enhance the gameplay. These mods have been optimized for performance, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted experience.

Step into the immersive world of Exploria where you can build a thriving town in the overworld, create a stronghold in the dangerous Nether, and establish a majestic city in the End. But before you can undertake these ambitious projects, you must defeat the evil tyrant who has invaded your humble abode.

As you construct impressive structures, you'll unlock valuable rewards that will help you overcome challenging bosses and obtain coveted artifacts through meticulous crafting. The end dimension has been expertly revamped with the Stellarity mod, and the difficulty has been raised with Extravanilla's hard mode, making your journey even more thrilling.

Embark on this exhilarating adventure and indulge in the endless opportunities for exploration and enjoyment that Exploria has to offer.
